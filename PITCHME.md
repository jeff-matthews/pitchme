## Migration

Migration was a prevailing theme among partners. On average, they are requesting:

- More resources to help manage client expectations. Partners spend a lot of pre-sales time setting expectations.
- Use cases, general timelines, and typical mappings for attributes.
- A map of common M1 libraries to M2 features.
- Guidance on integrating with third-party services (e.g., payments, marketing, CRM, ERP, OM, BI).
